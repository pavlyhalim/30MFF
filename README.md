# Project Description

The curated project is a website that allows users to share their short films with other cinema enthusiasts. The general idea was to raise awareness about overworking oneself and not taking time to recharge and have fun every now and then. In our film, we examine the issue of friendship and its relevance to our academic performance and mental welfare.

# Process

We decided to express the issue, which is really sensitive, using humor and things that people can connect to.

# Reflection/Evaluation

Throughout our undergraduate studies, we intend to raise awareness about the significance of human connection and socializing by creating an advertisement/short film about it. The film was enjoyable to shoot because it was with our friends and allowed us to unwind from difficult obligations. For the coding portion of the project, we experimented with numerous fonts, themes, and colors in order to arrive at the final version that we are satisfied with.
